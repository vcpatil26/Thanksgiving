We have conduct Quality-assurance with Team One, in order to help each other improve the code and be successful.
we try to test their application, view their code and view their previous Videos.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Before we get started, Here's few steps to set your machines up:
1) Install pip - A python package installer
http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html

2) Install Virtualenv and create a virtualenv on your machine
pip install virtualenv

3) Check out git code to the directory where virtualenv was created.

4) Activate virtualenv using the command
source bin/activate

5) Install requirements using:
pip install -r django_app_requirements.txt

Some important django commands: 

Once you go into the directory, say 
./scripts/activate

To start the server: 
python manage.py runserver

For database changes to be reflected, 
run :
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
After that I logged in the homepage of their application called "Task Sharing", here you can view and add "contacts", 
and view and add "Groups" with the taps on the top. In the group you are able to add tasks and assign "points" to them.
The tasks can be one-time tasks or recurring tasks.
When you finish a task, you can go to "Finish task" and mark it as finished.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
There are something can be done to make the application better:
1. There should be more restricting on the Task Naming and Time range. For example the start and end date of recurring tasks have
a Year range from 1990 to 2015. This can cause problem after 2015.

2. Whether the task is available is decided by the time, but this time is the computer system time but not the universal time. 
It is better to set it as universal time.

3. For new users I hope there to be more information on the homepage, and more information about how to assign one-time tasks 
recurring tasks.

4.For iteration 3, most task have been finished.
